## Convenience wrapper so a bare `make` in the source root works, while
## every generated file stays in ./build (the source tree is never touched).
##
##   make             configure ./build if needed, then build (in parallel)
##   make install     build if needed, then install (`sudo make install`)
##   make deb         build a .deb package in ./build
##   make clean       remove compiled objects, keep the configuration
##   make distclean   remove ./build entirely
##
##   make JOBS=8                      override the job count
##   make CMAKE_ARGS="-G Ninja"       extra arguments for the first configure
##
## Under sudo, configuring and compiling run as the invoking user ($SUDO_USER);
## only the copy into the system runs as root, and the install manifest it
## writes is handed back afterwards. So `sudo make install` never leaves
## root-owned files in ./build.
